        <p>The content about the story:
              “In the beautiful time of the year called "Summer", in which I did not stop enjoying those beautiful
              memories in which she enveloped me, maybe she also thought the same as me. We, on the beach, where
              we could not stop thinking about our dreams and our vision of things. When we see the sunrise, I
              suppose it is always a good moment, we talked about ourselves, about what each other felt, in which we
              would lean on to face the things that come our way. After that day, the usual routine, since she is my
              neighbor, because she came to my house to wake me up, although I also went to her house to wake her
              up if she did not get up before her. We may be very strange because of this, but honestly, we loved it.
              Although there is something that she did not know how to do, make breakfast in the morning. I cooked
              her scrambled eggs with chorizo ​​and some omelets to complement the dish, because I always saw her
              jumping for joy at having that type of breakfast, since she is not from this country, but from the United
              States, although I must admit that her name In part it is not from that place, it is called "Lisa Nanase",
              although I understand "Lisa", but the "Nanase" is Japanese, I suppose that parents did not want to leave
              their own children without a name that defines them. Although she is related to the Japanese, she is
              blonde, tall, well defined physically and with blue eyes, that's right, her typical eyes she has too. That is
              why she likes this type of food very much, as if it were magical for her, although I must admit that this
              type of food will not help her in the future. Well, I make myself some scrambled eggs, so as not to have
              such a heavy breakfast, although she doesn't need to do that type of diet, she does a good exercise. Well,
              as expected, finishing breakfast on our way to school, holding hands, maybe without knowing it, we are
              someone who could be classified as "Couple". Although without knowing it, this will not be a good day
              for anyone.”</p>
